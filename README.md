challenge_2_restful_crud
========================

This worked better with the database given by bootcamp, but sadly I no longer have access to that. 

There is no way to create a new note or user with the application, but I'm gonna keep the repository anyways. 

### Steps to run:

clone repo

cd into repo

run bundle install

run rake db:create

run rake db:migrate

run shotgun 

got to localhost:9393
